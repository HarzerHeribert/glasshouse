# Capability evidence — phase 2a

Split from the single evidence ledger this project used to keep at the repository root (see `docs/product/evidence/README.md` for the full index and the entry template / evidence rules that used to precede it).

### Phase 2A — Make unsupported platform/harness combinations fail with a clear diagnostic rather than a partial broken session

Contract: Given a platform and harness combination Glasshouse knows cannot
work, when a session or probe would otherwise be started, Glasshouse refuses
before any process exists and says what is wrong and what to do about it,
rather than starting something that appears alive while operating on the wrong
directory or the wrong process namespace.

State: COMPLETE

Production evidence — the combinations Glasshouse knows, and where each is
refused:

- **UNC project root + `.cmd`/`.bat` harness** — `launch::unsupported_combination`,
  called by `HarnessLaunch::build_command` before the command is returned, so
  `spawn` never reaches PTY creation. `cmd.exe` cannot hold a UNC working
  directory and does not fail when asked to: it substitutes the Windows
  directory and runs, so the session would have looked alive while operating
  outside the project entirely.
- **WSL + a Windows-interop executable** — `platform::exec::resolve_with`
  filters `/mnt/c`-style hits and returns `ResolveError::WindowsInteropOnly`,
  whose message explains that the child would run in the Windows process
  namespace where the project's Linux path is meaningless.
- **No usable executable** — `session::select::SelectionError::NotInstalled`
  names the candidate names that were tried.
- **A requested integration that is not a harness** —
  `SelectionError::NotAHarness` names the category and lists the harnesses
  that can be launched.
- **A harness turned off in configuration** — `SelectionError::Disabled`.
- **No terminal to attach to** — `session::attach::attach` refuses rather than
  hanging on a pty query nothing can answer.

Regression evidence:

- `a_script_harness_in_a_unc_project_is_refused_with_a_diagnostic` asserts the
  message names the directory, the reason, and the remedy — not merely that it
  failed.
- `every_other_combination_is_allowed` keeps the refusal narrow: a `Direct`
  harness in a UNC directory, and a script harness in an ordinary local or
  verbatim-drive directory, must all still launch.
- `unc_detection_covers_both_spellings_but_not_a_verbatim_drive` pins that
  `\\?\C:\...` is a local path despite also starting with two backslashes.
- `cmd_and_bat_are_windows_scripts_only_on_windows`,
  `a_nonsense_slug_is_unknown_and_names_the_valid_ones`, `cmux_is_not_a_harness`,
  and `attaching_without_a_terminal_is_refused` cover the other refusals.

Failure/isolation evidence:

- The refusal happens in `build_command`, before `PtyProcess::spawn`, so no
  process, pty, or terminal state exists when it fires. Non-vacuity (mutation
  actually run): disabling the condition makes the refusal test fail.

Platform/external evidence:

- CI green on `ubuntu-latest`, `macos-latest`, `windows-latest`, and lint. The
  check is a function of a path's shape and an executable's kind, with no
  `cfg` gating, so all three platforms execute it.

Honest limits:

- No real UNC share was exercised. The *refusal* is platform-independent code
  that CI runs everywhere; what is taken from documented Windows behaviour,
  not from a live run, is the premise — that `cmd.exe` would substitute the
  Windows directory rather than fail. That premise is why the refusal exists,
  and it was already recorded as a known limitation before this change.
- This capability covers the combinations Glasshouse currently knows about. A
  newly discovered one would reopen it.

### Phase 2A — Support native Windows as a first-class Glasshouse runtime where the selected harness is available

Contract: Given native Windows with an installed harness, everything Glasshouse
can currently do — resolve a project, isolate its state, discover harnesses,
probe versions, and open a real harness session inside the project root — works
the same way it does on macOS and Linux, and any combination that cannot work
is refused rather than half-started.

State: COMPLETE

This is a summary capability. It is checked because every capability it
summarises is checked and because the same test suite that backs the macOS and
Linux boxes now runs, and passes, on `windows-latest` — not because Windows was
judged by a weaker standard than its siblings.

Production evidence — the Windows-specific paths, all reachable in production:

- `pty`: ConPTY through `portable-pty`, with `process::JobHandle` giving
  Windows a kill-the-whole-tree equivalent that `TerminateProcess` alone does
  not provide — which matters precisely because a `.cmd` harness makes the real
  process a grandchild.
- `platform::exec`: `.exe`/`.cmd`/`.bat` classification, `cmd.exe /D /C`
  translation, `plain_script_path` conversion of the verbatim form `cmd.exe`
  cannot open, and rejection of `cmd.exe` metacharacters in arguments.
- `platform::paths::strip_verbatim_prefix` and `Project::display_root`: a
  canonical Windows root is verbatim, which is correct as an identity and
  unusable at a process boundary, so it is stripped there and only there.
- `launch::unsupported_combination`: refuses the one combination known not to
  work rather than starting a session that would run outside the project.

Regression evidence actually executed on `windows-latest`:

- CI run `32790669974` on `53e98f0`: **197 lib tests and 21 PTY smoke tests,
  0 failures**, plus lint, alongside green `ubuntu-latest` and `macos-latest`.
- `the_launch_command_opens_the_configured_harness_inside_the_project_root`
  runs the shipped binary in a real ConPTY and confirms a `.cmd` harness
  starts in the project root, with project-over-user executable precedence and
  exit-code propagation.
- `a_fake_installed_harness_launches_inside_the_discovered_project_root`
  exercises the real `cmd.exe /D /C` translation and asserts the canonical root
  was verbatim before `display_root` stripped it.
- `a_direct_executable_launches_through_the_harness_seam` covers the `.exe`
  branch, whose verbatim path had never been confirmed acceptable to
  `CreateProcess`.
- The PTY smoke suite proves output streaming, input, resize, and exit
  detection against a real ConPTY child.

Failure/isolation evidence:

- Windows CI caught two defects local gates could not: `cmd.exe` refusing the
  verbatim script path (so **no `.cmd` harness could start at all**), and a
  test comparing Windows path spellings that differ while denoting the same
  directory. Both are fixed and covered.
- Project-root refusals, the canonical-path guard, and per-project database
  isolation all execute in the Windows lib suite.

Honest limits — these are true on every platform, not Windows-specific:

- The interactive multi-session TUI does not exist yet (Phase 3), so
  "first-class runtime" means parity with macOS and Linux in what Glasshouse
  can do *today*, which is exactly the standard those two boxes were checked
  against.
- UNC project roots are refused for script harnesses rather than supported.
